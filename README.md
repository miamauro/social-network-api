# Social Network API

## Description

This application provides an API for a social network that uses a NoSQL database in order to handle large amounts of unstructured data. Watch the Demo Video (within a Google drive) linked below to see the routes tested in Insomnia.

Express.js is used for routing, MongoDB for the database, and Mongoose as the ODM.
